Light Dimmer Botastra project with Arduino
This product/bot is supposed to adjust led lights as per the light coming from the window.Although sensors(LDR) used in  the bot are not efficient enough to differenciate the window lights.So we used phone light as a replica.Same algorithm can be used to for Window light  also if we use better grade of sensor.
In our project LDR sense the light and turn on and turn off the leds according to it.
